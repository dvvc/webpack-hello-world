# La Pela

La Pela is a web application to track personal finances. It is also an exercise
in configuring a realistic application using modern web technologies. This is
the appication's log, where I'll track the initial setup of the build pipeline.

## Chapter 1: A Basic Hello World Client Application

The first step consists in creating the initial application, without too many
bells and whistles. Just show "Hello World" in a client page.

### Steps
1. Create the main application directory `mkdir lapela`
2. Init the git repository `git init .`
3. Init the NPM package `npm init -y`
4. Create a `client` directory `mkdir client`
5. Create a `client/index.html`, `client/index.js` and `client/styles.css`
6. Visit index.html in browser
